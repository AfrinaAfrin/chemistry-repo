    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

    <p><b>Chemistry</b> is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as <dfn>Fe</dfn> for iron, <dfn>H</dfn> for hydrogen, and <dfn>O</dfn> for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
    
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

    <p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved. Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while superscripts represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h2>Important Concepts</h2>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding chemistry is fundamental to many scientific and practical fields.</p>
